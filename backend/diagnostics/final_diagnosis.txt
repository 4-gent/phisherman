Final Diagnosis: Inspector "Could not find Agent" Error
========================================================
Date: 2025-01-25

Root Cause Identified:
=====================
The Inspector URLs point to `http://127.0.0.1` which is LOCALHOST (your computer).
The Agentverse Inspector runs in YOUR BROWSER and cannot access localhost URLs directly.

Why This Happens:
=================
1. Inspector tries to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8001` from the browser
2. Browser tries to connect to YOUR local machine
3. This works for development but requires the agents to be running AND accessible
4. The agents ARE running and responding to HTTP ✅
5. BUT the Inspector may need HTTPS or cannot resolve localhost properly

Current Agent Status:
====================
✅ All 5 agents running on ports 8001-8005
✅ All agents responding to HTTP requests:
   - Port 8001: {"status":"ok","agent":"phish_master","version":"1.0.0"}
   - Port 8002: {"status":"ok","agent":"finance_phisher","version":"1.0.0"}
   - Port 8003: {"status":"ok","agent":"health_phisher","version":"1.0.0"}
   - Port 8004: {"status":"ok","agent":"personal_phisher","version":"1.0.0"}
   - Port 8005: {"status":"ok","agent":"phish_refiner","version":"1.0.0"}

✅ All agents have required endpoints:
   - /health ✅
   - /agent_info ✅
   - /chat ✅
   - /generate ✅

The Problem:
============
The Inspector URLs require:
1. Agents to be running (DONE ✅)
2. Agents to be HTTP accessible (DONE ✅)
3. BUT the Inspector running in browser may need:
   - HTTPS instead of HTTP
   - Public hostname instead of 127.0.0.1
   - Or ngrok/tunneling to expose localhost

Possible Solutions:
==================
1. Use ngrok to tunnel localhost to public URL
2. Use HTTPS locally (complex)
3. Check if browser can access localhost (security restrictions)
4. Try opening inspector URLs directly: https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8001

Next Steps:
===========
Try the simple approach first - just open the Inspector URLs WITHOUT the address parameter.
The Inspector should be able to discover agents running on localhost automatically.
