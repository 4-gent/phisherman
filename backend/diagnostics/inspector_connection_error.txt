Inspector Connection Error Diagnosis
====================================
Date: 2025-01-25
Issue: "Could not find this Agent on your local host"

Problem Analysis:
=================
The Inspector URLs show agents are running but Inspector can't connect to them.

Current Status:
- All 5 agents running on ports 8001-8005 ✅
- All agents listening on TCP ports ✅
- Agents have correct addresses ✅
- Inspector can't find agents ❌

Possible Causes:
1. Agents not exposing HTTP endpoints for Inspector
2. Mailbox mode not properly configured (use_mailbox: False in logs)
3. Missing health/status endpoints
4. Network binding issue (127.0.0.1 vs 0.0.0.0)

Key Finding from Logs:
======================
Mailbox config shows: 'use_mailbox': False

This indicates mailbox mode is NOT actually enabled despite mailbox=True parameter.

Agent Log Snippet:
==================
INFO:     [phish_master]: Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Mailbox: {'agent_mailbox_key': None, 'base_url': 'agentverse.ai', 'protocol': 'https', 'http_prefix': 'https', 'use_mailbox': False}

Root Cause:
===========
The mailbox=True parameter is not actually enabling mailbox mode. The agent.mailbox dict shows use_mailbox: False.

Solution Needed:
================
Need to properly enable mailbox mode or use a different approach for local agent registration.
The Inspector URLs are correct but agents need to be accessible via HTTP endpoints.

Alternative: Use the FastAPI-based agents (mailbox_agent.py) which have proper HTTP endpoints.
