Current Status Summary
======================
Date: 2025-01-25

AGENTS ARE WORKING:
===================
✅ All 5 agents running and responding to HTTP
✅ Port 8001: phish_master - {"status":"ok","agent":"phish_master","version":"1.0.0"}
✅ Port 8002: finance_phisher - {"status":"ok","agent":"finance_phisher","version":"1.0.0"}
✅ Port 8003: health_phisher - {"status":"ok","agent":"health_phisher","version":"1.0.0"}
✅ Port 8004: personal_phisher - {"status":"ok","agent":"personal_phisher","version":"1.0.0"}
✅ Port 8005: phish_refiner - {"status":"ok","agent":"phish_refiner","version":"1.0.0"}

INSPECTOR ISSUE:
================
❌ Inspector shows "Could not find this Agent on your local host"

REASON:
=======
The Fetch.ai Agentverse Inspector cannot access localhost (127.0.0.1) agents from the browser.
This is a common browser security restriction.

WHAT TO DO:
===========
For CalHacks Demo:
1. Show agents working via curl/Postman
2. Demonstrate HTTP endpoints
3. Explain the architecture
4. Note that full Agentverse integration requires deployment

Agent HTTP Endpoints (All Working):
===================================
- http://127.0.0.1:8001/health
- http://127.0.0.1:8001/agent_info
- http://127.0.0.1:8001/chat
- http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate

(Same for ports 8002-8005)

YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THE AGENTS WORK - THEY JUST CAN'T BE ACCESSED BY INSPECTOR FROM BROWSER
