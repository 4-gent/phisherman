Corrected Inspector URLs (without addresses)
============================================
Date: 2025-01-25
Status: FastAPI agents running with HTTP endpoints

Issue Identified:
================
The previous uAgent-based agents (phish_master_mailbox.py, etc.) were NOT exposing HTTP endpoints
for the Inspector to connect to. They were just Python processes listening on ports but not responding
to HTTP requests from Agentverse Inspector.

Solution Applied:
================
Switched to FastAPI-based mailbox_agent.py which properly exposes HTTP endpoints at:
- /health - Health check endpoint  
- /agent_info - Agent information endpoint
- /chat - Chat Protocol v0.3.0 endpoint
- /generate - Template generation endpoint

New Inspector URLs (Simplified - without addresses):
====================================================

1. phish_master (Port 8001):
https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8001

2. finance_phisher (Port 8002):
https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8002

3. health_phisher (Port 8003):
https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8003

4. personal_phisher (Port 8004):
https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8004

5. phish_refiner (Port 8005):
https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8005

Verification:
=============
