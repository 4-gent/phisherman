Manual Connection Steps:
=======================
For each Inspector URL that opened in your browser:

1. **Click the "Connect" button** on the Inspector page
2. **Select "Mailbox" option** when prompted
3. **Wait for connection confirmation** - you should see a success message
4. **Copy the resulting mailbox endpoint URL** - this will be the real Fetch.ai mailbox URL
5. **Record the mailbox endpoint** for Agentverse registration

Expected Results:
================
After connecting each agent through the Inspector UI, you should receive:
- Real mailbox endpoint URLs (not the fake ones we had before)
- Connection confirmation messages
- Agents will show as "Mailbox Connected" in the Inspector

Next Steps:
===========
1. Complete the manual connection process for all 5 agents
2. Record the actual mailbox endpoint URLs provided by Fetch.ai
3. Use those real endpoints in Agentverse registration
4. Test agent communication through Agentverse

Notes:
======
- All agents are running with mailbox=True configuration
- Inspector URLs are opened in browser tabs
- Manual connection is required - cannot be automated
- Only use the mailbox endpoints provided after successful Inspector connection
