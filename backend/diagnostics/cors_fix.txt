CORS Fix Applied
================
Date: 2025-01-25

Issue Identified:
================
The Inspector was sending OPTIONS requests (CORS preflight) and receiving:
"OPTIONS /agent_info HTTP/1.1" 405 Method Not Allowed

This prevented the Inspector from connecting to the agents.

Solution Applied:
================
Added CORS middleware to mailbox_agent.py:
- allow_origins=["*"]
- allow_credentials=True
- allow_methods=["*"]
- allow_headers=["*"]

Agents Restarted:
================
✅ All agents restarted with CORS enabled
✅ Agent on port 8001 verified responding: {"status":"ok","agent":"phish_master","version":"1.0.0"}

Next Steps:
==========
1. REFRESH the Inspector browser tabs
2. The agents should now be detected
3. You should be able to click "Connect" → "Mailbox"

Inspector URLs (refresh these):
