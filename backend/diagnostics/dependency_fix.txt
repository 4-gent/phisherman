Dependency Fix Report
====================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- uagents-core 0.3.3 has conflicting dependencies with uagents 0.10.0
- ecdsa version conflict: uagents-core requires >=0.19.0, uagents requires <0.19.0
- pydantic version conflict: uagents-core requires >=2.8, uagents requires <2.0.0

SOLUTION APPLIED:
1. Removed uagents-core==0.3.3 from requirements.txt
2. Kept uagents>=0.10.0 as the main package
3. Added FastAPI and uvicorn for Chat Protocol compatibility

FINAL REQUIREMENTS.TXT:
```
# uAgent dependencies for Fetch.ai ecosystem
uagents>=0.10.0
httpx>=0.24.0
typing-extensions>=4.0.0
fastapi>=0.100.0
uvicorn>=0.20.0
```

INSTALLATION COMMANDS:
```bash
cd /Users/raghavgautam/Documents/GitHub/phisherman/backend
python3 -m pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

RESULT:
- Dependencies installed successfully
- Some version conflicts remain but are non-critical
- uagents 0.10.0 is working with current setup
- FastAPI and uvicorn added for Chat Protocol v0.3.0 compatibility

NOTE: The remaining conflicts are between uagents-core (if installed separately) and uagents, but since we're using uagents as the main package, this should not affect functionality.
